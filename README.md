# SiteLimitCRX
A chrome extension which gives you a time allowance for websites you choose each day
# Brief
Hello. This is my project to teach myself how to code for the web. I am building a chrome extension which gives you a
daily timelimit for your chosen website. After the timelimit has been reached, you are required to win a simple game to 
unlock more time(kind of like a snooze button on an alarm). The game is meant to be a deterrent for wasting more time
than intended on a given website i.e facebook. If you do not complete the game you must wait untill the next day to 
reuse the website. The game appears after you have used up your alloted time.
