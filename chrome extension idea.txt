make an app that only allows you to view a website for an amount of alloted time each day
i.e youtube allowence 1hour means that you can only look at youtube for one hour each day

constraints
-could be hard to know when someone is using those websites
--perhaps you could check the link of the current open tab,
-- and if it corrosponds to whatever you have an allowence for then 
-- then you could say, start the countdown of the daily allowence
-time, knowing when to reset
--store last time chrome was used or app did something, if last time was before reset point(which time you can set)
-- then reset
--or could store the last time something was reset, if time is greater than 24 hours, then reset
